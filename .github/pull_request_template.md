Before making a pull request
----------------------------

- [ ] Make pull request title clear and descriptive
- [ ] Link(s) to issue describing bug fixed or need for change
- [ ] Make sure all tests run
- [ ] Update the changelog appropriately

Description
---------------------------
If no issue is linked, describe the changes made. Issues can
be [linked explicitly](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
with a URL or through use of the issue number e.g. `Closes #274` will link to
`https://github.com/internetofwater/nldi-services/issues/274`.

Note anything that you want the reviewers to know while reviewing your pull request.

After making a pull request
---------------------------
- [ ] If appropriate, put the link to the PR in the JIRA ticket
- [ ] Assign someone to review unless the change is trivial
